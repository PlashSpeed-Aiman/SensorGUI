   - [ ] Create ViewModels for all screens (HRM, SRM)
   - [ ] Move business logic from UI components to ViewModels
   - [ ] Implement proper data binding between Views and ViewModels

2. [ ] Create a unified sensor data management system
   - [ ] Implement a central SensorDataRepository
   - [ ] Create data models for different sensor types
   - [ ] Implement proper data flow from sensors to UI

3. [ ] Implement dependency injection
   - [ ] Add Koin or Dagger Hilt for dependency management
   - [ ] Configure DI for ViewModels and Services
   - [ ] Refactor existing code to use injected dependencies

4. [ ] Improve error handling and logging
   - [ ] Implement a centralized error handling mechanism
   - [ ] Add proper logging throughout the application
   - [ ] Create user-friendly error messages

5. [ ] Implement unit and integration testing
   - [ ] Set up testing framework (JUnit, Mockk)
   - [ ] Write tests for ViewModels
   - [ ] Write tests for Services
   - [ ] Implement UI tests for critical flows

## Code-Level Improvements

6. [ ] Refactor UI components
   - [ ] Break down large composable functions into smaller, reusable components

   - [ ] Extract hardcoded values (colors, dimensions) to constants

7. [ ] Optimize TCP client implementation
   - [ ] Implement connection pooling
   - [ ] Add timeout handling
   - [ ] Implement automatic reconnection logic
   - [ ] Add data serialization/deserialization for structured messages

8. [ ] Improve state management
   - [ ] Use StateFlow consistently across the application
   - [ ] Implement proper state restoration on configuration changes
   - [ ] Handle edge cases in state transitions

9. [ ] Enhance sensor data visualization
   - [ ] Implement charts/graphs for sensor data
   - [ ] Add historical data view
   - [ ] Implement data export functionality

10. [ ] Implement proper resource cleanup
    - [ ] Ensure all coroutines are properly cancelled
